	  <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Theme</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
	<h3>Depression</h3>             
Depression is amongst adolescents (young people between 14-22 years of age) a major problem and of societal concern. Yearly it has many personal victims (deaths by suicide) and brings along high social and healthcare costs. Taking a step back, individualization and loneliness are common and of great importance but among youth is a stigma-laden theme. Overall, depression has a negative impact on our societal wellbeing and has a strong dampening effect on our economy.
</p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
With the 'Connect' initiative our aim is to draw attention to the importance off “offline connection”: the significance and essence of belonging and the power of friendship. We want to emphasize the essence of focusing on humanity; authentic connection and personal attention are of great importance to overcome mental distress and disease..
   </p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
   <h3>AI</h3>             
Another  development of great importance and relevance, is the rise and application of artificial intelligence (AI) in our society. We see the development of so-called chatbots, which is growing in many domains. An example how it is applied in healthcare, is the support in tumor detection whilst analyzing scans. 
   </p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
In 'Connect' we aim to interweave both topics. We wonder to what extent the development and application of AI in our society, and as a result in the field of mental health care, affects and influences the problem of the increasing depression among young people. 
   </p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
There are two sides to this: AI in the form of Digital Care Coaching offers promising solutions in the approach of tackling depression on a large scale. Digital coaches can support specialists in monitoring patients and assist them in interventions, for example through suggesting proactive motivational messages to patients.
Of course, the question also arises, to what extent digital coaches can really meet the need for beneficial social connection. Even in the era of AI , personal development will go hand in hand with forms of human attention and mutual cooperation.
<br/>
   </p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
 <h3>Industry</h3>
Despite the increasing influence of AI in our society, a real breakthrough for digital coaches is still lacking. This has its reasons. There are strict rules regarding privacy and responsible usage in healthcare. In addition, there are budgetary issues, mainly looking at financing by health insurers. As a result, startups hardly get off the ground or only develop silo solutions with no scaling-up.
   </p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
It is to be expected that more e-health applications will be developed by the gaming industry in the near future. One can think of, for example, e-health applications with VR glasses in the form of apps on mobile phones, or special 'e-care' modules that can be part of an online game or social platform. This could be of relevance and therefore a good development. From a commercial perspective, there is often much more room for development and maintenance, and in return, due to the extensive use, more attention is paid to the problem.
   </p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
However, every development also has its dark sides. For example, it is conceivable that these games can become addictive. Unconsciously on the part of the user, or worse: consciously instigated by the developer and supplier. Consider all kinds of merchandising, which can actually influence the vulnerable and impressionable users.
Competing suppliers can also attack each other digitally, post hacks and negatively influence each other's product at the expense of users. Competition and insatiable hunger for money can lead to proliferation with adverse effects to the users who try to overcome their psychological distress or depression with the use of gaming modules.
</p>
   <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
   <h3>Connected</h3>
   All of this reinforces the necessity and importance of social connection. This goes beyond “friendship”, “humanity” and “attention”, dealing with “trust” and “independence” are also of importance in making people stronger.

	  <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Activities</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
We would preferably like to work together with young people on the aforementioned theme through a selection of activities. This is not just about the results, but also about the road to get there. By working together we are already on the way in contributing to solving the problem. By connecting the various activities, everyone can participate based on their own talent and interests.

<h3>Writing stories</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
Writing is a way to share and/or process experiences. With the help of our “community mindset” it will even be possible to expand a story or replace parts of a story.

</p>

<h3>Apps and Chatbots</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
We are looking at the development of online chatbots and apps that function as digital coaches. For example, the technology of a Fitbit app or the analysis of the data collected with it. Both techniques (open source chatbots) and issues about how to design an app (and even make it addictive) are discussed.
</p>
<h3>Movie makers</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
A story needs to be felt and experienced. Making a film encourages the writer's message to be experienced in a certain way. Directing and acting will actually provide this experience. Together with young people we want to create films in which they can recognize themselves.

	  <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">The initiative</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
The ‘Connect initiative’ arose from meetings of two namesakes, each enthusiastic and proactive in their own field: Wico Mulder, youth physician, public health specialist and mental health advocate and Wico Mulder, expert in the field of IT and artificial intelligence. With their inquiring mind and intrinsic drive to connect, they share the need to undertake activities together with young people. They had an idea for making a film that could be fictionalized, but also saw that that would be too compartmentalized an activity. The interwoven themes require continuous attention and can best be tackled in the form of a community project. The name 'Connect' was coined as the title of the film but is now the name of this community initiative. It relates to both the need for social connection in a world where AI plays an increasingly important role, and the way in which we draw attention to this; a community project.
